My Kiln Share allows you to drop off your work to be bisque or glaze fired, and you only pay for the space you use.

You may fire any clay or glaze as long as you know the cone it needs to be fired to. I typically bisque fire to cone 04 and glaze fire to cone 6. If you need to fire to a different temperature, you'll be responsible for paying the cost for the full firing since I will be unable to batch other work into the same firing.

If you're not familiar with ceramic firings or cones, but you know what clay and glaze you are working with, I'm happy to help with the details.

Any damage to the kiln shelves will incur a $10 shelf scraping fee per shelf. If your pieces are likely to drip, you're required to provide your own cookies to fire on.

I am not responsible for any work that is deemed unusable/non-sellable from the result of over firing, kiln
error, or accidental damage. In the case of a misfire/underfire of the kiln, I will re-fire the work at no
additional cost.

Payment will be coordinated after I load the kiln with your pieces so that I can accurately determine how much space they will need during the firing.
