Monthly members schedule lessons and/or studio share time per-hour through a scheduling link that does not require additional payment, or by arranging a recurring weekly or bi-weekly schedule.

All memberships are month-to-month and can be canceled at any time, or can be paused for up to three months for free (such as if you are travelling, but will be back).

I can only accept a limited number of monthly members to ensure that the studio has enough availability to accommodate all members. If the membership option you are interested in is not currently available, please <%= link_to "send me an email", contact_path %> to be added to the waitlist.

In addition to what is included in the <%= link_to "hourly studio share", studio_share_path %>, all monthly memberships include the following:

 - Bisque and glaze firings at 50% off my <%= link_to "Kiln Share", kiln_share_path %> prices
 - Bi-weekly member meet-and-greets
